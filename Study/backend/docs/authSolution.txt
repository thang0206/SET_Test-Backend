1. My solution: Make use of loopback Authentication Component, loopback JWT extension, and loopack Authorization component

2. Strong point:
  + A lot of documents in loopback page
  + Good with an Enterprise application where you need to work on some complex data models
  + Adapt a lot of core features

3. Weak points:
  + Might be hard to adjust as the company, customer want
  + Harder in coding compared with other ways

4. To improve my solution, I think nothing better than taking it seriously, spending time going over docs and trying to set up a complete loopback backend.

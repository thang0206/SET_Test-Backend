1.	With UML you have already designed on question 1, what database are you using to implement?
-	With UML designed on question 1, I’m using NoSQL database and MongoDB as an open source NoSQL database management program.2.

2.	Why are you using that? What is the strong and weak point of it?
-	The reason for using this database is because:
+ I’m more used to using it.
+ I find NoSQL database more suitable with the UML designed on question 1.
-	Strong points:
+ Performance: faster than SQL.
+ Scalability: Easy to scale out .
+ Flexibility: Flexible document Data model.

-	Weak points:
+ NoSQL databases don’t have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don’t support ACID).
+ Is not compatible (at all) with SQL.
+ NoSQL are very new compared to Relational Databases.
